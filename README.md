# SSD4Rec

It is a novel generic and efficient sequential recommendation backbone, which explores the seamless adaptation of **Mamba** for sequential recommendations. Specifically, SSD4Rec marks the variable- and long-length item sequences with sequence registers and processes the item representations with bidirectional Structured State Space Duality (SSD) blocks. This not only allows for hardware-aware matrix multiplication but also empowers outstanding capabilities in **variable-length and long-range sequence modeling**.

## Usage

### Enviroment Requirement
You can refer to the required environment specifications in environment.yaml.

### Implement

An simple example to run SSD4Rec on the ML1M (Default) dataset:

```shell
python main.py
```

We provide four processed datasets: ML1M, Amazon-Beauty, Amazon-Games, and KuaiRand-Pure. If you want to run experiments on other datasets, you should go to `config.yaml` and replace the variable of `dataset` correspondly.
